# Data Structure

## Team Contract (mqiu3-daweix3-hanbog2-lurenw2)

##Communication

### 1.Team Meetings 
Our team will meet at least once a week with flexiable schedule using wechat to talk about the process.

### 2.Assistance
Each team member can be contacted through wechat. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours.

### 3.Respect
every member of the group should have a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision. However, design decisions can be accpted by simple majority - while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. Each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

## Collaboration

### 1.Work Distribution
Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned the task.

### 2.Time Commitment
Each member is expected to work no less than 2 and no more than 6 hours (you can work 24 * 7 if you want) per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication.
