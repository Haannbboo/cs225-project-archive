# Week 1

- Constructed main structure and came up with appropriate algorithms for our project (Astar, Dijkstra, Dstar)
- Gathered and validated data quality.
- Confirmed reliability of data source.
- Did research on related algorithm(Astar, Dijkstra, Dstar) 
 
# Week 2
- Created Map, Point, Road class for our project. Map represents the map we run graph algorithms on together with some methods that is able to interact with point and map class. A point class contians the name of the place, the best estimate of distance to this point, a vector of points connected to this point etc. An road class mainly describe the road name, lengh, w/o brisge, if it's on way and some other properties of it.
- Based on the data source we got from last week, we read the data csv file without using any non-standard library in C++. We created a class called line to store all records of data in the csv file. Line class contians a data point class which is basically just one record of data point and use vectior to store the data point class we created.
